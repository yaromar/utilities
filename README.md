# Utilities for Data Science & Bioinformatics

This repository contains a collection of general-purpose helper scripts, templates, and functions that I develop and reuse across multiple projects. 

They are organized into categories for easier navigation and reuse.

## Repository Structure

- **data_wrangling/**  
  Scripts for cleaning, harmonizing, and reshaping datasets (e.g., sample ID alignment, metadata QC).

- **bioinformatics/**  
  Tools for working with NGS and omics data (e.g., VCF parsing, FASTQ QC, annotation helpers).

- **machine_learning/**  
  Reusable components for model training, feature engineering, and evaluation.

- **visualization/**  
  Templates and helper functions for creating consistent, publication-ready plots.

- **hpc_cloud/**  
  Scripts for HPC job submission (SLURM) and cloud workflows (AWS S3 transfers, environment setup).
